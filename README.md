## Model features

TEMOA-Piedmont is a model instance for the optimization of the Piedmont energy system developed within an [extended version](https://github.com/MAHTEP/TEMOA) of the [TEMOA](https://temoacloud.com/) (Tools for Energy Modeling Optimization and Analysis) modeling framework.

The model is maintained by the [MAHTEP Group](http://www.mahtep.polito.it) at [Department of Energy](https://www.denerg.polito.it/en/) of [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/en). For any communication related to TEMOA-Italy, please write to [farzaneh.amirkavei@polito.it](mailto:farzaneh.amirkavei@polito.it).

The techno-economic modeling of new technologies in the TEMOA-Piedmont database mostly refers to the [TEMOA-Italy](https://github.com/MAHTEP/TEMOA-Italy/) model. A schematic representation of the modeled energy system is shown in Figure 1.
